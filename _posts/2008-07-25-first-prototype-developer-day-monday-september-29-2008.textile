Prototype Core is happy to announce the first Prototype Developer Day!  The Prototype Developer Day is going to be a recurring event bringing together Prototype Core members and users from the Prototype community to share experiences, offer insight into what's coming up, and discuss topics like contribution, support, and the Prototype ecosystem.  If you're big on Prototype, you cannot miss this!

This fall, the Prototype Developer Day is being held in conjunction with "The Ajax Experience":http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com, held in Boston from Monday, September 29 to Wednesday, October 1 2008.  The Prototype Developer Day itself will happen on Monday.

*Admission to the Developer Day is free*. If you’re interested in attending the full three days of The Ajax Experience, you can *save $100 with the code @Prototype@*. Register before August 22nd and *save an additional $100*.

The provisional agenda for this Prototype Developer Day is as follows (more details coming up on the "full agenda":http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/eventsataglance.html?Offer=AEprot717):
