   *  Class.create([superclass][, methods...]) -> Class
   *    - superclass (Class): The optional superclass to inherit methods from.
   *    - methods (Object): An object whose properties will be "mixed-in" to the
   *        new class. Any number of mixins can be added; later mixins take
   *        precedence.
   *
   *  [[Class.create]] creates a class and returns a constructor function for
   *  instances of the class. Calling the constructor function (typically as
   *  part of a `new` statement) will invoke the class's `initialize` method.
   *
   *  [[Class.create]] accepts two kinds of arguments. If the first argument is
   *  a [[Class]], it's used as the new class's superclass, and all its methods
   *  are inherited. Otherwise, any arguments passed are treated as objects,
   *  and their methods are copied over ("mixed in") as instance methods of the
   *  new class. In cases of method name overlap, later arguments take
   *  precedence over earlier arguments.
   *
   *  If a subclass overrides an instance method declared in a superclass, the
   *  subclass's method can still access the original method. To do so, declare
   *  the subclass's method as normal, but insert `$super` as the first
   *  argument. This makes `$super` available as a method for use within the
   *  function.
   *
   *  To extend a class after it has been defined, use [[Class#addMethods]].
   *
   *  For details, see the
   *  [inheritance tutorial](http://prototypejs.org/learn/class-inheritance)
   *  on the Prototype website.

  /**
   *  Class#addMethods(methods) -> Class
   *    - methods (Object): The methods to add to the class.
   *
   *  Adds methods to an existing class.
   *
   *  [[Class#addMethods]] is a method available on classes that have been
   *  defined with [[Class.create]]. It can be used to add new instance methods
   *  to that class, or overwrite existing methods, after the class has been
   *  defined.
   *
   *  New methods propagate down the inheritance chain. If the class has
   *  subclasses, those subclasses will receive the new methods &mdash; even in
   *  the context of `$super` calls. The new methods also propagate to instances
   *  of the class and of all its subclasses, even those that have already been
   *  instantiated.
